Chapter 22 Exercise 8

In previous chapters, we've used the scanf format string " %c" when we want
to skip white-space characters and read a nonblank character. Some programmers
use "%1s" instead. Are the two techiques equivalent? If not, what are the
differences?

The are not quite equivalent. %s is a string and will have a null character
inscerted at the end of the character array.
