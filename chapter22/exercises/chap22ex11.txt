The following loop appears in the fcopy.c program:

while ((ch = getc(source_fp)) != EOF)
    putc(ch, dest_fp);

Suppose that we neglected to put parentheses around ch = getc(source_fp):
while (ch = getc(source_fp) != EOF)
    putc(ch, dest_fp);

Would the program compile without an error? IF so, what would the program do
when it's run?

The program will compile without error, however it will behave differently due
to operator precedence. As we don't have parenthesised the assignment operation
, as the assignemnt operator ( = ) has lower precidence than the equality
operator ( != ), the result of the equality operation getc(source_fp) != EOF)
(e.g 1 ) will be assigned to the char variable.
